# Manage landing page

## Hello everyone! ðŸ‘‹

This is my solution for the Frontend Mentor challenge called ***Manage landing page***.

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

The users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See all testimonials in a horizontal slider
- Receive an error message when the newsletter sign up `form` is submitted if:
- The `input` field is empty
- The email address is not formatted correctly

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.
